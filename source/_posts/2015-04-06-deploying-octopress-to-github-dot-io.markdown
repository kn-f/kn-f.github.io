I wanted to take a chance to try the *linklog* solution but it's "too complex" for what I need.

Basically I wanted to link this entry to a blog page explaining how to setup and link an *Octopress* blog to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
<!-- more -->
Among all the articles I read, this looked the easiest and most clear. If you just follow it you'll be able to deploy your blog in *github* as well as use it as a standard git repository for the sources.

This is the link: [Deploying Octopress to github.io](http://bayendor.github.io/blog/2013/07/17/deploying-octopress-to-github-dot-io/)[^1]

[^1]: Yes, shame on me, I even copied the title of the blog entry ;)
