I'm currently working on a project in [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2). The game belongs the the *idle* category where  you've to configure something and then wait for it to to harvest resources that you'll spend to improve the configuration to harvest more and faster.faster

The basic idea behind the *idle* games is extremely simple and still a well realized *idle* game is extremely addictive. The principle behind it is the same that made *Pokemon* a great success: collectioning.
For some reasons whenever we can we collect things: *vynils*, *stickers*, *cars*, *knives*...it's in our nature to do so. And to make things easier for *lazy* people like me, *idle* games come to help by *automating* (not really, but allow me this semplification) what should be repetitive tasks like collecting *money*.money

You just need to wait without spending time on the game itself and you'll get the benefits. The fun factor is moved to the pure discovery of *"what's next"* and to spend your resources wisely so that it will take less and less to you to get the resources necessary to improve.

Some games like [Adventure Capitalist](http://www.kongregate.com/games/HyperHippoGames/adventure-capitalist) are quite a hit with a huge amount of improvements and *replayability*
