What follows is the first post I wrote back in 2012 before leaving the idea.
Iâ€™d like to keep it as a reminder of its original intent.

{% blockquote %}
It happens to me, while implementing an IT solution to ask to myself: why should I?: Why should I use Nagios? Why should I virtualize the server?Why should I use a PHP framework?

Sometimes the original solution is the best, other times I discover alternatives that solve better the problem we had. Aim of this blog is to document my experiences detailing the reasoning behind the choices and a review after a few months of usage.

Hope this helps! :D
