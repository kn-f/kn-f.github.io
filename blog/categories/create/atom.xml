[Koding](https://koding.com/) is briliant but needs a little bit of polishing to be a day to day tool.

I was very inspired while writing (yes I was listening to some music:[Neon Future I](http://open.spotify.com/album/3KYFjFzw34AhmlxQC8r5W6)) so probably it's better like this.

The point is that whenever I feel like I need lots of concentration, when I want ot be isolated from the world, I put on my headphones and listen to some music. Not always my favourite songs; actually depending from how I feel I can listen to *classical*, *heavy metal*, *electro*.

Every kind of music has a reason, each song has its piece of code, its part of the drawing that has inspired. The right music helps my creative flow, makes me feel like I&#8217;m just copying an existing script: no need to think, no need to review.

Then when the music ends and I check what I&#8217;ve done, the experience tells me that it&#8217;s not as good as it seemed to me when I was creating it. But still the influence of the music is there.

What&#8217;s your experience? Do you listen to music while creating?]]></content>
