Meh..:( Looks like I just lost the post...
[Koding](https://koding.com/) is briliant but needs a little bit of polishing to be a day to day tool.

I was very inspired while writing (yes I was listening to some music:[Neon Future I](http://open.spotify.com/album/3KYFjFzw34AhmlxQC8r5W6)) so probably it's better like this.

The point is that whenever I feel like I need lots of concentration, when I want ot be isolated from the world, I put on my headphones and listen to some music. Not always my favourite songs; actually depending from how I feel I can listen to *classical*, *heavy metal*, *electro*.

Every kind of music has a reason, each song has its piece of code, its part of the drawing that has inspired. The right music helps my creative flow, makes me feel like I'm just copying an existing script: no need to think, no need to review.

Then when the music ends and I check what I've done, the experience tells me that it's not as good as it seemed to me when I was creating it. But still the influence of the music is there.

What's your experience? Do you listen to music while creating?
