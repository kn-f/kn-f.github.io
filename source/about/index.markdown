This blog is an idea that I had some time ago at work. Basically back than we had to take some important decisions about the future of the company. Every decision had some pros and some cons so the point was to document these and in the future comment the outcome.

Then I moved to another company and left this in the *to do* list. Finally, after two years of "meditation" I took the decision to make this idea a reality so there you are.

Aim of the posts is not to blame or brag, it is to try to give some insights on the decision, the decision process and the outcome.
