<a href="https://koding.com/">Koding</a> is briliant but needs a little bit of polishing to be a day to day tool.</p>

<p>I was very inspired while writing (yes I was listening to some music:<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3KYFjFzw34AhmlxQC8r5W6">Neon Future I</a>) so probably it&rsquo;s better like this.</p>

<p>The point is that whenever I feel like I need lots of concentration, when I want ot be isolated from the world, I put on my headphones and listen to some music. Not always my favourite songs; actually depending from how I feel I can listen to <em>classical</em>, <em>heavy metal</em>, <em>electro</em>.</p>

<p>Every kind of music has a reason, each song has its piece of code, its part of the drawing that has inspired. The right music helps my creative flow, makes me feel like I&rsquo;m just copying an existing script: no need to think, no need to review.</p>

<p>Then when the music ends and I check what I&rsquo;ve done, the experience tells me that it&rsquo;s not as good as it seemed to me when I was creating it. But still the influence of the music is there.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your experience? Do you listen to music while creating?</p>
