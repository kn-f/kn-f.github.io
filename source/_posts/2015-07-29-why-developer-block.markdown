In a [previous post]({% post_url 2014-12-29-once-i-was-a-developer %}) I was extremely happy to say that my *developer's block* was no more.

Unfortunately that was just an illusion since just a few weeks later I fell again in it...and I was in that situation until very recently.
<!--more-->
It was a hard hit when I realized that I didn't want, that I couldn't work on my [project](https://github.com/kn-f/EmuProj) anymore: even if I had spare time I could not put down a single line of code, not even a ``echo "Hello world"``. I felt like it was a too complex task, taking too much time, much more time than the one I had. I felt I didn't have the skills (this one is actually true) to face the project I was working on.

Every time the same story and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it. Then I found this [article](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=How_to_Write_a_Roguelike_in_15_Steps); it didn't solve the problem but it started to move something inside me and I understood that I just didn't had to *get it right* at first, I just had to start moving. And so I did: I listed all that was a blocking point for my *developer's inspiration* and for each I proposed myself a solution. What came out is quite interesting (please keep in mind that I'm developing as a hobby)

1. *It is a very complex task*: The article on how to write a Roguelike game really helped: 
2. *I have to dedicate too much time to it*: I really didn't tackle this point, I just realized that even dedicating 15 minutes every day to the project, it's still progressing!
3. *I don't have the skills*: True, nothing to hide here. But one of the reasons why I loved programming was because I could always learn something new. So here I am working on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Fat Free Framework](http://fatfreeframework.com/) looking on how I can *hidrate* an object.
4. *I need to get it right at first*: Uhhmm...really? Why? Once ready the project will not be usused by 1 million users at the same time, performances will be a problem but in a later stage. And the *product* itself? Who cares! I'm doing this as an hobby, if no one likes it, never mind, I've learned already so many things!

I'm sure in the future I'll face this block again several times and for different reasons but as long as I'm aware of it and I know what the reasons are... :D
