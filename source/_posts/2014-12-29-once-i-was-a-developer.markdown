This is one of these days where I need to write. I'm sure I'll never publish this post but at least let's give it a go.
*Once I was a developer*, or at least this is what I think.
<!--more-->
I started "writing programs" when a I was about 6. I still have a program (but it should be more accurate to call it a composition of existing programs) that I wrote on paper when I was about that age. Nothing complex but at that time the *discovery* of the fact that I could *create* was incredible.

> 2/4/2015 - At that time I did not complete the post. I wanted to write that since a year or so I lost the will and drive to develop.
> Now it's important for me to make the post public as finally it looks like I got back the inspiration!
