    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of these days where I need to write. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll never publish this post but at least let&rsquo;s give it a go.
<em>Once I was a developer</em>, or at least this is what I think.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I started &ldquo;writing programs&rdquo; when a I was about 6. I still have a program (but it should be more accurate to call it a composition of existing programs) that I wrote on paper when I was about that age. Nothing complex but at that time the <em>discovery</em> of the fact that I could <em>create</em> was incredible.</p>

<blockquote><p>2/4/2015 - At that time I did not complete the post. I wanted to write that since a year or so I lost the will and drive to develop.
Now it&rsquo;s important for me to make the post public as finally it looks like I got back the inspiration!</p></blockquote>
